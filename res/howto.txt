|Data Structures|

Use the operations "Insert", "Delete" or "Search" on a Key to
fill the animation buffer. You can also open a demo file with a pre-scripted
series of commands. This should be formatted like the following:

operation:key
operation:key

|Media Controls|

There are two modes for using the media control buttons, which can be
chosen from the menubar at the top:

"Single Command" mode:

	Stop -> Go to the start of the last operation
	Previous/Next -> Go forward/backward one step
	Play/Pause -> Start/ Pause the animated last operation

"All Commands" mode:

	Stop -> Go to the first operation
	Previous/Next -> Jump to the next operation
	Play/Pause -> Play/Pause the animation of all operations
